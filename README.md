# Olympic-Lifespan-of-Success
This project explores the relationship between age and Olympic success by analyzing the ages of gold medal winners across different sports. Using historical athlete data, the project investigates which sports favor younger or older athletes, visualizes age distributions with kernel density plots, and highlights patterns in performance longevity.
